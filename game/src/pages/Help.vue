      <p>
        Whoever finds a lost pet, by typing the 15-digit code of the microchip
        or the tattooed one in the database of the Pet Registry, can trace the
        pet's registry office and find useful numbers or references to contact
        to trace the owner. Consultation of the database is free. To obtain the
        identification code, it is possible to read the microchip at the
        veterinary services of the ASL, private veterinary clinics and the
        municipal police equipped with the appropriate reader. (Adapted and

        Animal assisted activities, education and therapies
      </h2>
      <p>
        The old term pet therapy is still used to indicate a varied range of
        interactions with animals, more or less complex, aimed at the care,
        rehabilitation, education and promotion of people's well-being and
        quality of life. These different declinations are now divided into
        activities, education and animal-assisted therapy and together they
        constitute animal-assisted interventions (IAA). (Adapted and translated

      <p>
        The Registry of Affectionate Animals is the national register of dogs,
        cats, and ferrets identified with microchips in Italy. It is a database,
        fed by the individual territorial registries, which intends to provide
        online references useful for tracing, in compliance with the protection
        of citizens' privacy: the place of registration of the animals and their
        rightful owner. (Adapted and translated from salute.gov.it)
